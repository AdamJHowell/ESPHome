# ESPHome

This repo holds all of my ESPHome projects.  For more information, see the README.md in the appropriate subdirectory.

A secrets.yaml file should exist in each subdirectory.  That file will need to contain at least the following keys:

* encryption_key
* ota_password
* wifi_ssid
* wifi_password
* wifi_ssid_backup
* broker_address

And possibly other keys.
