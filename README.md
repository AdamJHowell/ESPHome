# ESPHome

This repo holds all of my ESPHome projects.  For more information, see the README.md in the appropriate subdirectory.

A secrets.yaml file should exist in the root directory.  That file will need to contain at least the following keys:

* wifi_ssid
* wifi_password
* wifi_ssid_backup
* broker_address
* encryption_key
* ota_password

And possibly other keys.
